# Clock-Stopwatch
This is a repository for a java project that creates a clock which can turn to a stopwatch and vice versa

More about the project:
As mentioned in the description of the repository, this is a java project. If you run the main method, then with the use of
the CardLayout a digital clock will be created. The clock shows the current time and underneath that is the day, the month and the year.
After these, there is a button. If you press the button, then with the use of the CardLayout the title will be changed from 'Clock' 
to 'Stopwatch' and the layout will also change. In the new layout there are 3 buttons and a timer. You can start the timer, pause the timer,
and reset the timer. The other button with the title of "Clock" will change the layout back to the clock one.

This is a begginers project, so if you really want to try it you can download the code and compare it to yours.
Also there is a good amount of comments in the code to help you understand how everything works.
