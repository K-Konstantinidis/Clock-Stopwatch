# Clock-Stopwatch
This a java project that creates a clock which can turn to a stopwatch and vice versa.

More about the project:
This is a java project. If you run the main method, then with the use of
the CardLayout a digital clock will be created. The clock shows the current time and underneath that is the day, the month and the year.
After these, there is a button. If you press the button, then with the use of the CardLayout the title will be changed from 'Clock' 
to 'Stopwatch' and the layout will also change. In the new layout there are 3 buttons and a timer. You can start the timer, pause the timer,
and reset the timer. The other button with the title of "Clock" will change the layout back to the clock one.

This is a beginners project, so if you really want to try it you can download the code and compare it to yours.

For more information about how the code works, there are lots of comments in the .java files to help you understand everything and follow along with ease!
